explanation of the algorithms used in the Cairo Transportation Network 
Optimization project, along with a comparison table and the libraries involved: ### **Algorithms Used in the Project** 
#### **1. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) - Network Design** #### **2. Dijkstra's Algorithm - Traffic Flow Optimization** #### **3. A* Algorithm - Emergency Response Routing** #### **4. Dynamic Programming (DP) - Public Transit Optimization** #### **5. Greedy Algorithm - Traffic Signal Optimization** ### **Key Insights** 
1. **MST** is best for infrastructure planning where cost minimization is 
critical. 
2. **Dijkstra's/A*** excel in pathfinding but trade off speed vs. optimality. 
3. **DP** handles transit scheduling well but requires more computational 
resources. 
4. **Greedy algorithms** provide quick solutions for traffic signals but may not 
be globally optimal. 
5. The libraries work together to: 
   - Streamlit for the UI 
   - Folium for geospatial visualization 
   - Pandas/NumPy for data processing 
   - Plotly for statistical charts . . This combination of algorithms and libraries creates a comprehensive 
transportation optimization system for Cairo.  . . . . Theoretical 
 simplified explanation of Team 7's A* algorithm project for 
emergency routing in Cairo:**Project Goal:**   
Find the fastest way for ambulances to reach hospitals in Cairo's busy 
traffic using smart computer algorithms. 
 
**Why A*?**   
It's like a smart GPS that: 
1. Knows the straight-line distance to the hospital (like a crow flies) 
2. Considers real traffic conditions 
3. Finds the best balance between speed and accuracy 
 
**How It Works:**   
The algorithm uses this simple formula to decide which roads to take: 
``` 
Total Cost = (Distance Traveled) + (Estimated Distance Left) 
``` 
 
**Real-World Adjustments:** 
1. **Traffic Matters:** Roads cost more during rush hour 
(morning/evening) 
2. **Smart Guessing:** Uses straight-line distance to the hospital to 
avoid checking useless routes 
3. **Road Rules:** All roads work both ways, and bad road conditions 
increase travel time
